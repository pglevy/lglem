When do you need an event manager? For almost any event you would like to host—from a small dinner party in your own home to a gala for a foundation or corporation.

There are many separate elements that must be considered and managed when hosting a successful and memorable event. Things to consider are:

**Date of the event**—send a _Save the Date_ notice, even if you don’t have a confirmed location.

**Location**—book as soon as possible. Some organizations book events from 3 to 5 years out.

**Theme**—decide if one is appropriate. Though not all events require a theme, some companies plan a yearly theme.

**Invitations**—consider these details of the invitation:

- guest list—as a priority, make sure you have a current mailing list so that valuable time isn’t lost in updating an old list.
- reply card—keep it simple. include all pertinent information for an easy response.
- postage—keep it limited to current postage otherwise this detail can be costly.
- mailing—mail invitations 6–8 weeks prior to the event date to insure early responses and to avoid competing events.

**Photographer**—contract a service about one month before the event.

**Flowers**—select seasonal blossoms according to the time of year. Also, depending on the room where the event is being held, arrangements don’t need to be elaborate.

**Menu**—there are a few choices here. Choose a menu that has a steak and chicken combination [making sure to include a vegetarian option], ask guests in advance of their preference, or depending on the size of the event, include a selection of main meals on the reply card.

**Music—**if appropriate, select a live band or piped-in music.

**Video**—if any kind of historical information or data is being presented as part of the program, secure this service from a qualified vendor.
