> “Leah Levy is the entire package. She is bright, energetic, loyal, professional and gifted. She is the ultimate professional. An event managed by Leah Levy will not only be a success, it will be a supreme success.”

Frank Keating<br>
former Governor of Oklahoma<br>
currently, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association

> “I have known Leah since she worked for Secretary Elizabeth Dole, Secretary Jack Kemp, and most recently while I was the Secretary of Labor. Leah always demonstrated a high energy, strong work ethic, loyalty, and a dedication to public service. She is a self-starter, is anticipatory, thinks strategically and comprehensively. Her careful attention to detail and strong organization skills will undoubtedly serve her clients well for their event planning needs.”

Elaine L. Chao<br>
former Secretary of Labor

> “My first acquaintance with Leah was at the U.S. Department of Housing under the leadership of Jack Kemp where I found her to be an exceptional resource and colleague.
> 
> When I subsequently became the President of Empower America (now FreedomWorks), I asked Leah to join EA/FW as the Vice Presidential of Development. In both work environments, Leah always demonstrated the highest level of professionalism and sound judgment. The success of our events were a direct result of Leah’s creative and organizational skills. While Leah always had sound ideas pertaining to an event, she was always open and flexible to other ideas and suggestions to ensure the perfect outcome.“

Empower America—now FreedomWorks

> “Leah Levy has a long record of delivering vital support to not only the Jack Kemp Foundation, but also Jack Kemp. After being a critical support to my dad during his career, Leah began helping the Kemp Foundation on our yearly events and has organized our contact lists, supported our staff, handled details like flower arrangements, managed relations with Members of Congress and their staffs and done whatever else needed to be done. She is a professional who cares about people and it shows. I endorse LGL Event Management and am happy to serve as a reference.“
