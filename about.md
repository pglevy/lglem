## My wish for you…
Irish Blessing—an Illustrated Edition 1990:

May good luck be your friend
In whatever you do,
And may trouble be always
A stranger to you.

Like the warmth of the sun
And the light of the day,
May the luck of the Irish
Shine bright on your way.

Come and take pot-luck with me
My hearth is warm, my friendship’s free.
